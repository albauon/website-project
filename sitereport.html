        <p>On my navigation design, on css I have added an active action. When users clicked it changes the font weight to bold, this is just subtle visual indicator. Also added a hover state.</p>

      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>During the website project, I was quite confident since I have previous experiences on web development, coming from my GCSE's year in which I used Dreamweaver, however it is a massive changed since I found that I'll be using vs code. However, by following the module exercises, tt felt like putting Lego bricks for me and as soon I got a "base" for my page. That's where I added more complex (as for me it was) design.<br>
      I tried my best following the HTML5 semantics and personally I do not feel, I have demonstrated it but partially and definitely need to work on this on future projects. Lastly, was debugging and coding in which I used "Markup Validation Service" which was a really great tool to check any errors within my source code. I will keep using this on future projects therefore making my code neat and clear.<br>
      The biggest struggle for me was the Hamburger menu, doing it purely css was difficult and I did not understand the tutorial provided. So what I did was by using a simple vector image for the hamburger menu and adding a very small of js script. Which I think, it worked perfectly. Adding the animation was quite fun, I was able to play around but for minimalistic view.<br>
      For my UI design, I got influenced by Formula 1 car liverly which they have this very unique colors, therefore I decided to go with the teal and different shades of greys. The navigation bar specifically, I wanted to give a simple design but with small amount of visual ques which helps me personally when navigating websites.<br>
      Overall, I feel that my website is responsive and able to changed into a mobile version when web browser is changed, I think the design can be better specially fonts and visual detail, maybe an interesting background(?) and richer colour palette. Also I would prioritise the way I layout my website, there is a lot of improvement on my columns skills as seen on CV Page it is all over the page.</p>
